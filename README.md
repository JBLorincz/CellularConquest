# CellularConquest
A small project I made in my spare time, which simulates colonies of cells fighting each other to conquer the entire window. It's not really optimized and in its current state, the colony which spawns closest to the top-left has an advantage due to how the combat algorithm works, but I had alot of fun and learned alot making this. 


Made on VS2015 with C++ using SFML
