# CellularConquest
A machine learning powered simulation where colonies of cells compete to be the last one standing.
Machines will learn how to balance their offense and defense (and alliances, in the future) optimally in order to become the last colony standing.

NOTE: Cellular Conquest has just started development. IT IS NOT READY YET

Made on VS2015 with C++ using SFML
